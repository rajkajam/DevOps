Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.

 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/rajkajam/DevOps.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

Issue: You have created a new repository, added a few commits to it, and now you are trying to pull from a remote repository that already has some commits of its own. Git will also throw the error in this case, since it has no idea how the two projects are related.
Solution: The error is resolved by toggling the allow-unrelated-histories switch. After a git pull or git merge command, add the following tag

git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories ( https://www.educative.io/edpresso/the-fatal-refusing-to-merge-unrelated-histories-git-error)
